## Introduction

Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning that focuses on algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. The field has gained significant attention due to its success in solving complex problems such as image recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous driving. These notes aim to break down the key concepts in deep learning to help students understand both the theory and practical implementation of various deep learning models.

## Topics Covered

The notes are divided into the following key areas of Deep Learning:

1. **Introduction to Neural Networks**
    - What are neural networks?
    - Perceptron model
    - Layers and architecture

2. **Activation Functions**
    - Sigmoid, Tanh, ReLU, Softmax
    - The importance of activation functions

3. **Training Neural Networks**
    - Forward and backward propagation
    - Gradient descent and optimization algorithms (SGD, Adam, etc.)
    - Loss functions (Cross-Entropy, MSE)
